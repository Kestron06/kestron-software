                Hello, my name is Kestron. I'm an aspiring seventeen year old Christian programmer and the developer of search engines, Discord bots, Minecraft bots, websites, chromium-based browser extensions, games, animations, logos, Voice Assistants, and much more. I have made smaller contributions to a number of other projects.
                I used the Running Start program for seven quarters, or two years, starting at age 15 to study for an AAS-T Software Development degree. I have since completed the Running Start program, and if all goes well will be graduating with a diploma and an Associates within a year.
                I hold fast to a strong code of ethics, meaning you can trust me not to track you, or put intrusive ads or high price tags on my stuff. I hope to continue to keep everything free, however complications in real life may force my hand to charge at some point. For now, enjoy my stuff free of cost.
                Previously I would've told you that I was going to be a Software Developer full time eventually, however new developments in my personal life have made me reconsider this.
