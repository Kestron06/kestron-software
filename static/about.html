                Hello, my name is Kestron. I'm an aspiring Christian programmer and the developer of search engines, Discord bots, Minecraft bots, websites, chromium-based browser extensions, games, animated memes, animated logos, and I am currently working on a Voice Assistant. I have made smaller contributions to a number of other projects.
                I am currently using the Running Start program to study for an AAS-T Software Development degree, and if all goes well will be graduating within a year. I hold fast to a strong code of ethics, meaning you can trust me not to track you, or put intrusive ads or high price tags on my stuff. I hope to continue to keep everything free, however complications in real life may force my hand to charge at some point. For now, enjoy my stuff free of cost.
            </p>

                I started over 5-6 years ago, when I logged onto <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> for help with mathematical operations. After I figured out what I needed to, I just started poking around the site.
                I stumbled across the Computer Programming section and started taking the tutorials. It sucked me in, and I kept going with it. I wasn't very skilled with it, but a variety of things helped me grow with it.
                The first being a program posted by a user named Mr. Jprograms remaking Nintendo's Super Mario Odyssey in a 2D setting. It got me hooked, and when Mr. Jprograms stopped work on it I picked up in his stead.
                A multitude of other users joined me in helping to further the program, but complications with the site prevented us from ever finishing. However I pushed a lot of my skills further working on it.
                My skills moved very little for a few years, until I joined a user-made contest by Iron Programming called Primavera. During this contest I pushed past the last few things holding me back. My skills rose quickly, until I was terminated from the site for my religious views.
            </p>

                I fought hard for a little while, but eventually it just wasn't worth it anymore. I still pop up from time to time, and do things in the shadows, but ultimately I have moved past the educational site.
                During this time, I was desperate to reconnect with my friends I had made. I had made a Discord account for assistance modding one of my gaming consoles, and ended up joining one of the Khan Academy Discord servers. From there, I was invited to another one known as Khancord. This server helped me with many things.
                In this server I ended up seeing one of the Discord bots a friend of mine from Khan Academy had made, and decided to make my own. At first I really had no idea what I was doing, as Node.js isn't completely different from Processing.js but it's a lot more console based, which I wasn't used to.
                I also was not familiar with how to read/write files or use APIs. Making my own Discord bot helped me to learn how to do these.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's basically what brought me to where I am now. My skills are still improving every day, and I hope to continue this trend of rising skills for many years to come.
